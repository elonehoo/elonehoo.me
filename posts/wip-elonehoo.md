# Hi üëãüèº

> [‰∏≠Êñá Chinese Version](./wip-elonehoo-zh)

I am very happy that you can read this article. This is a new plan of mine. I have opened a new [<span i-simple-icons-github /> GitHub organization](https://github.com/wip-elonehoo). I will put my wonderful ideas in it. You are very welcome to join.

It's very easy to join, you can send an [<span i-cib-minutemailer /> Email](mailto:hi@elonehoo.me) or send a message to my [<span i-simple-icons-twitter /> Twitter](https://twitter.com/elonehoo), pulling you into the organization.

If a project is finished enough to be used, it will be open-source in a week.

You can have early access to them and give early „Äåfeedback / requests„Äç or even participate in decision making, those might affect how and where the projects go.
