I have migrated my blog from [nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) to [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/).

<GitHubCard to="https://github.com/elonehoo/elonehoo.me/pull/62" type="pull" status="merged" title="refactor: migrating nuxt to vitepress" />

This might seem like a step back, but because I used [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) in [nuxt content](https://content.nuxt.com/) and I'm not very good at writing plugins for it, I wanted to use [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it).

So I took some time to complete this migration, of course, the blog is not fully done yet.
