I always feel that I need a beautiful blog but I never have one.

So I took some time to rewrite my homepage and adding the blog section. and Hi, here I am :)

This time I gave a try on [vite-ssg](https://github.com/antfu/vite-ssg) and it works petty well. 

As for the blog, I am likely to do some bilingual stuff in the future. Some posts will be written in English, some might be in Chinese. 

The site is still WIP, if you have any thoughts or suggestions, please tell me via [email](mailto:hi@elonehoo.me) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elonehoo). Thanks!

:)
